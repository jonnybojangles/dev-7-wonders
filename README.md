Dev 7 Wonders !
===
While playing the tabletop game Seven Wonders I was asked if it would be possible to program the first step,
dealing wonder cards. This is my attempt at doing so while practicing private members as detailed by Crockford.
Additionally, I have wanted to create an HTML/CSS based card game for sometime now, so I incorporated those aspects as well.

- Created a HTML/CSS playing card
- Created a CSS animation to deal and flip the card
- Created a Civilization class for a civilization card
- Added a cache manifest file for offline support

Example

???

To Do
---
- Validate that hardware acceleration is being used for all animations.
- (maybe) make cards use a ratio of window/device width and/or height
- Suggest user add to their home screen to make use of full screen mode and offline cache
- Add example
- Decouple play/deal logic from markup. Maybe use AngularJS instead of jQuery. I hate that template/clone.
